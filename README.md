# BingRewardsAutomatedSearch
This is a poorly written Python script which searches for random 32 character strings in Bing to get the daily reward points.  You still have to manually click on the questions or multiple choice quizzes though.  Edit the path to the "msedgedriver.exe" file.

Requirements:
python 3.11.1
pip install msedge-selenium-tools==3.141.4 selenium==3.141.0

Download the webdriver for edge here:

Change the driver executable path in the script to wherever you put the webdriver executable.
